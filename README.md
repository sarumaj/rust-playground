# rust-playground

**rust-playground** is a collection of multiple projects I have worked on, while learning Rust. They advance from basics and descend steadily deeper into more complex features of the runtime.

## Projects:

- [avg](avg): A tiny program utilizing OOP to calculate the arithmetic average value.
- [bloody song](bloody_song): A program displaying lyrics of a bloody Christmas song using smart repetitions.
- [blogger](blogger): A simple OOP-based interface for writing blog posts.
- [bricks](bricks): A small program to build a wall with bricks.
- [company directory](company_directory): A simple program using a hash map to store employees by departments.
- [fibonacci](fibonacci): A Fibonacci series generator.
- [file handler](file_handler): A simple dialog allowing to delete a file, create it from scratch or append content to existing file.
- [first word](first_word): A program disassembling the first and the last words of a sentence.
- [forest](forest): A program drawing node trees, where each node can held multiple children and each child can held a weak reference to the parent (memory safe without reference cycles).
- [guessing game](guessing_game): Initial project about an interactive guess a number game.
- [gui](gui): A simple project mocking a GUI library.
- [ip address](ip_address): My implementation of IP v4 and IP v6.
- [lin alg](lin_alg): A simple program overriding standard arithmetic operations for a custom type Point.
- [maths](maths): A program calculating mean, median, mode and standard deviation given a vector of integers.
- [messenger](messenger): A program using a custom trait and implementing it.
- [minigrep](minigrep): A command-line tool like GNU grep.
- [pig latin](pig_latin): A program converting an input text to pig latin.
- [restaurant](restaurant): First project using multiple crates and modules, using both a lib and a bin crate. It mocks a restaurant with specified menu, limited capacity, and a revenue expectation.
- [tasker](tasker): A simple multi-threaded application.
- [temp conv](temp_conv): A simple interactive temperature converter (°C to °F and vice versa).
- [www](www): A multi-threaded web server using own thread pool implementation.
- [zoo](zoo): A program using super traits and the new type pattern to implement them.
