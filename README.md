# rust-playground

**rust-playground** is a collection of multiple projects I have worked on, while learning Rust. They advance from basics and descend steadily deeper into more complex features of the runtime.

## Projects:

- [bloody song](bloody_song): A program displaying lyrics of a bloody Christmas song using smart repetitions.
- [bricks](bricks): A small programm to build a wall with bricks.
- [fibonacci](fibonacci): A Fibonacci series generator.
- [first word](first_word): A programm disasembling the first and the last words of a sentence.
- [guessing game](guessing_game): Initial project about an interactive guess a number game.
- [ip address](ip_address): My implementation of IP v4 and IP v6.
- [restaurant](restaurant): First project using multiple crates and modules, using both a lib and a bin crate. It mocks a restaurant with specified menu, limited capacity, and a revenue expectation.
- [temp conv](temp_conv): A simple interactive temperature coverter (°C to °F and vice versa).
